# toy-problems
Toy problems from coding challenges encountered

##### Building from Source

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) wrapper is used for the build system

toy-problems was developed with [STS](https://spring.io/tools/sts) with the [Eclipse Buildship plugin](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjKz4G12MnmAhWSFTQIHfoABc8QFjAAegQIChAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprojects.eclipse.org%2Fprojects%2Ftools.buildship&usg=AOvVaw3w79u_pTg-smfQ0zfK5PIN) and can be imported as a gradle project. The project will automatically build as part of the import

run .`/gradlew assemble` to build outside of your IDE, classes will be generated in the `build` directory

##### Running Tests

`./gradlew build` to build and run unit tests
